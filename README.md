<h1>Financial Manager in C</h1>

During my second semester of the Computer Science bachelor's degree, I had the opportunity to take the Algorithm Development course and develop a project that allowed me to put into practice the skills I learned. The project involved creating a software application that was completely written in the C programming language. The application had a range of useful features, including the ability to register expenses, incomes, bank transfers, and control balances. The project was developed by BRUNO ANDWELE ALVES ANTUNES and ANA BEATRIZ TAVARES MALHEIRO (@AnaBeatrizTavaresMalheiro).
